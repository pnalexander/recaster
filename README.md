### Reclaimed Wood ###

Recaster is extremely passionate about producing a product of exceptional quality that is stunningly beautiful and sounds even better.

The guys at Refab Wood build heirloom quality furniture made primarily out of reclaimed pine. This is our choice material because it is dense, stable, long-lasting, and breathtakingly gorgeous.

Reclaimed pine is a superior building material when compared to most store-bought pine. If you take a moment to think about it, you'll begin to understand why this is the case.

We're certain you've noticed many a barn alongside the road. A vast majority of these barns have been standing since before the turn of the 20th century. If the wood used to build these barns can last hundreds of years in the elements, it can certainly last significantly longer than the lifetime of a guitar.

That's just the beginning of why reclaimed pine is our preferred material. Imagine what it would have been like in the late 1800s to build a house or a barn. There was no Lowe's or Home Depot in existence. There was land, and on that land stood trees that had lived for hundreds of years.

To build your building(s) you would need to cut down these trees and mill the wood on-site, which is how most of these buildings were built. The trees had been standing, untouched for hundreds of years, if not longer. The longer a tree has to grow and the cleaner and healthier the environment, the denser and stronger it will be.

Now, compare what you've just learned to the way we harvest pine nowadays. We plant trees and allow them to grow for several years before harvesting them for wood. Not to mention that their short life is in an exceedingly unhealthy environment and polluted atmosphere. This wood is weak and soft meaning it will not hold up as a decent guitar building material.

Seeing that new sources of pine are not suitable for guitars, and wanting to pay some homage to the original Telecaster, reclaimed pine is the evident material of choice. Thus, Recaster was born.
